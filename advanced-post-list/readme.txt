== Description ==

[Home Page][code google apl].
This plugin gives you the ability to customize design, content, and the location of the saved post list.

This is an upgraded version of [Kalins Post List][wordpress kalins post list] that was unfortunately declared abandoned. Most of the credit for architectural ideas for creating a plugin like this goes to **Kalin**. I couldn’t see a nice plugin like this get left in the dark. 

This plugin is still in the first stages of its target design. A lot of the front end designs have remained the same while code in the background has been completely redesigned. Many of the old bugs have been fixed, excluding the few that require more research to reproduce



`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`

== Installation ==
1. Upload zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings->Advanced Post List to access the settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display the post list that I created? =
You need to locate and copy the shortcode. Which is in the Advance Post List - Settings page on the saved preset table. Then create a page/post and paste the shortcode on your page/post (eg. [post_list name='some-preset-name])' 

== Screenshots ==

1. Advanced Post List admin page.
2. Display an example of the preset post list.
3. Preset post list table.
4. Easy to use shortcodes to add to your page/post.
5. Example of the preset being used.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.b1 =
* ‘Post Parent’ combo box was corrected to now display only pages
* ‘Orderby’ combo box was corrected to pass values that wordpress allows with WP Query
* Edited some of the front end designs to make it current with the plugin
* Post data is now being correctly pulled within APL_run
* A clean up was done on 0.1.a1 

= 0.1.a1 =
Very first working version.
* Fixed 'Require all categories'.
* Upgraded core functions.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.1.1b =
* ‘Post Parent’ displays post instead of pages - The values being passed to ‘Post Parent’ was passing all the children of post and pages. Wordpress considers images and attachments to also be children of the post or page. Plus, the pages that didn’t have children yet, were not being displayed.
* ‘Orderby’ combo box wasn’t displaying correctly – Some of the ‘Orderby’ values being passed were either the wrong value or not an allowed value.
* Front end displayed incorrect content – Some of the old front end designs still remained.
* Post data being filtered was pulling the data incorrectly – The param values used in get_post in APL_run were incorrect values.

= 0.1.a1 =
* When 'Require all categories' was selected, the function would misread the post's category id, and keep it in the post list.
* Code should be easier to upgrade and add features
