This plugin gives you the ability to customize design, (post/page/attachment) content, and the location you want the post list to display.

This is an alternate/upgraded version of [Kalins Post List][wordpress kalins post list] that was unfortunately declared abandoned. Most of the credit for creating a great plugin like this goes to **Kalin**. As a plugin developer, I also admire the uses of this plugin. So, I couldn't see a nice plugin like this get left in the dark. 

This plugin is still in the first stages of its target design. Many of the old bugs have been fixed, and some new features added. A lot of the front end designs have remained relitively the same, but most of the backen code has been redesigned to classes/objects (for many reasons). Version 1.0.0 will feature many of the functionalities that Kalin and others have mentioned, and will have a completely new layout to accomodate for the extra tools that will be added. Right now the plugin is in the pre-release versions (0.X.X).

**0.2.0 Release** - contains an export function that also supports individual preset downloads. This is for two main reasons. *1)* Help with debugging purposes when trying to replicate the style and some of the content. *2)* Community purposes. It was a simple piece of code to add (maybe 5 lines, if that) for preset downlads after all the main export functions, and I also believe having a community will help with the evolution of the plug in by spotting the limitations and the advances needed for the plugin. 

**Pre-Release Projects for Version 1.0.0**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display the post list that I created? =
You need to locate and copy the shortcode. Which is in the Advance Post List - Settings page on the saved preset table. Then create a page/post and paste the shortcode on your page/post (eg. [post_list name='some-preset-name])'
